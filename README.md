# Cost-effective-webui
Please note that this is a high-level overview and does not include the intricate details required for this project such as managing cost constraints, 
ensuring ethical guidelines and legal regulations, understanding Google and YouTube's algorithm and web behavior monitoring practices, etc.
A more detailed and tailored solution would require a deeper understanding of the project scope and specific technical requirements. 
The provided pseudo code is intended to illustrate a general structure of how the project could be approached. 
It is not executable code and some of the functionalities implied (like creating aged Google accounts or assigning new IPs) may require external services or further implementation.

# Import necessary libraries
# This could include libraries for web scraping (like selenium), AI (like TensorFlow), IP management (like requests), etc.
